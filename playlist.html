    I must have sent four hundred poems on the way you used to smile at me <br>
    I used to write them for you daily but my thumbs are running dry lately <br>
    No one wants to hear a song about the <s>bitch</s> that broke my heart <br>
    I should've listened to my mama, she saw through you from the start <br>
    But now we're here in Regent's Park amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain <br>
    'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely that I'm falling for you over again <br>
    Since I have nothing left to say that will make you change your mind <br>
    I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day <br>
    There was a place not too dissimilar to this one where I first saw your face <br>
    You look like home, sat all alone, I should've found somebody cheaper to chase <br>
    Tragically, nobody told me how expensive you could be <br>
    I lost more than money, dear, you knocked the swagger out of me <br>
    But now we're here in Regent's Park amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain <br>
    'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely that I'm falling for you over again <br>
    Since I have nothing left to say that will make you change your mind <br>
